Plan ahead if you want to visit Fernando de Noronha, an archipelago of 21 islands and islets in the Atlantic Ocean. To protect these fragile islands, only 460 tourists are allowed to visit these unspoiled beauties per day. And you’ll definitely want to include Fernando de Noronha on your itinerary if you can. Conde Nast called this archipelago “possibly the most relaxing and most beautiful place” in the world. And the New York Times included Fernando de Noronha on its 2014 list of must-visit destinations. This high praise is well deserved. The waters around Fernando de Noronha are crystal clear and teeming with fish, dolphins and turtles, making them perfect for snorkeling and diving. You’ll also find plenty of lovely, deserted beaches, pretty coves and lovely waterfalls on these very special and very exclusive islands.
