Ilha do Campeche, which is located on the east coast of Florianopolis, boasts stunning white sand beaches and its very clear water are perfect for snorkeling. But this is not just another beautiful island. It is also home to more than 100 ancient petroglyphs. If you are interested in seeing some of these archaeological treasures, you can take a guided tour to see them. To preserve this amazing island, the number of visitors allowed per day is limited. In addition, visitors are only given four hours to explore the small island. Ilha do Campeche is also closed to visitors during the winter months.
