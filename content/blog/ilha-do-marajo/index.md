Ilha do Marajo is one of Brazil’s most unique islands. For one thing, it is not located in the ocean, but can be found at the mouth of the Amazon River. It is also very large, about the size of Switzerland. Ilha do Marajo is, in fact, the largest fluvial island in the world. This island is also famous for its tidal bore waves, which occur in the river and can be as high as 4 meters (13 feet). Ilha do Marajo is also home to thousands of birds, including herons and stunning scarlet ibis. The pace on this island is slow and relaxed. Don’t be surprised, for example, to find water buffalo wandering its streets. So if you’re searching for a quiet vacation in a natural setting, this island would make the perfect getaway.
