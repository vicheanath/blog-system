Ilhabela is a group of islands located on the northern coast of Sao Paulo. Its name means beautiful island, and visitors to Ilhabela are quick to discover why. These Brazilian islands are blessed with lovely beaches and more than 360 waterfalls. And its thick tropical jungles are home to wild monkeys and about 300 species of birds, including toucans. Ilhabela, which is known as Brazil’s sailing capital, hosts the Rolex International Sailing Week each year — the largest sailing competition held in Latin America. Other watersports, including surfing and snorkeling, are also very popular on these islands.
